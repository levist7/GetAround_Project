## Project  
Getaround is an online rental car rental service in an Airbnb way. When renting a car, users have to complete a checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental in order to:

*  Assess the state of the car and notify other parties of pre-existing damages or damages that occurred during the rental.
*  Compare fuel levels.
*  Measure how many kilometers were driven.
*  Ensure checkin and checkout policies

**First goal** is to resolve those issues and give insights on implementing a minimum delay between two rentals. A car won‚Äôt be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental. It can solve the late checkout issue but may hurt Getaround/owners' revenues.

**Second goal** is to provide an online API on Heroku server containing /predict endpoint that estimates the rental price per day.

## Deliverables  

Availabe deliverables üì¨:  

1-  Exploratory data analysis on Getaround data and test of various machine learning models  
2-  A dashboard in production. [Dashboard](http://getaround-dashboard-threshold.herokuapp.com)  
3-  A documented online API [API/docs](http://getaround-api-xgboost.herokuapp.com/docs) containing /predict endpoint that respect the technical descriptions.  

## Model performances

Machine learning model performances are summarized below:  

<img src = "/tracking/rmse_scores_experiments.png">

Please note that the results show the box plots of metrics obtained with cross-validation and K=4-fold attributions.    
In this project, the best performances were obtained by **XGboost regressor model** (experiment number 13). Therefore, it was taken into consideration to deploy together with the web API. The error metric is listed below:
* RMSE = 12.8 dollars on predicting car rental prices per day (mean of 4-fold scores)

*More details can be found under 'tracking' folder.*
