## Project  
Getaround is an online rental car rental service but in an Airbnb way. When renting a car, users have to complete a checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental in order to:

*  Assess the state of the car and notify other parties of pre-existing damages or damages that occurred during the rental.
*  Compare fuel levels.
*  Measure how many kilometers were driven.
*  Ensure checkin and checkout policies

The **goal** is to resolve those issues and give insights on implementing a minimum delay between two rentals. A car won‚Äôt be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental. It can solve the late checkout issue but may hurt Getaround/owners revenues.

## Deliverables  

Availabe deliverables üì¨:  

1-  A dashboard in production (accessible via the web page above)  
2-  An documented online API on Heroku server containing /predict endpoint that respect the technical descriptions.  
3-  Exploratory data analysis on Getaround data and test of various machine learning models  

## Model performances

Summary of machine learning model performances are shown below. It includes cross-validation and K-fold attributions.

In this project, **XGboost regressor model** (experiment number 13) is taken into consideration and deployed together with web API. The error metric is listed below:
* RMSE = 12.8 dollars (mean of 4 K-fold scores)

*More details can be found on 'tracking' folder*
